# C Data Structures

This is a toy implementation of some common C Data Structures. As of 2 June 2021 this repo is archived, and I have made a much more improved data structures [library](https://github.com/ntuckertriplet/libdatastructures) that is generic and can be used as a statically linked library for my own purposes in class and in personal projects.
